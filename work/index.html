<h2>Let me speed up your sites</h2>
<p>I help organizations build faster, more stable websites. I specialize in consulting related to <strong>frontend performance</strong> and <strong>automated testing</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have an interesting project in need of any of the following things I'm a great person to contact! Please use the button below to email me and we can begin a conversation.</p>

<ul class="Services">
  <li><strong>Frontend development</strong> — If it's the part of the app that lives in the browser, I'm all about it. I'm most familiar with React, Jekyll, and Drupal, but I'm pretty comfortable in any language or framework. I'm happy to augment your team and build accessible, performant frontend code for your website or app.</li>
  <li><strong>Frontend performance</strong> — I'll give your site a thorough inspection and deliver a report containing an actionable plan to improve your loading times.</li>
  <li><strong>Rendering performance</strong> — I'll use your website with a number of devices and measure how responsive and snappy the user interface is. I will deliver a report containing an actionable plan to make your user interface smoother, more intuitive, and when possible more energy efficient.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementing audits</strong> — I am almost always willing to take on short-term development contracts to implement the improvement plans I recommend.</li>
  <li><strong>Training workshops</strong> — You can hire me to do on-site training at your company or event. I have been training people to build performant, responsive websites since 2011 and would love to help your team next!</li>
</ul>

<h2>I can't help you with...</h2>
<p>I'm not a designer, I'm not great at application programming, and I'm not looking for a full-time position as an employee.</p>
<p>In order to be the best frontend developer I can be, I choose not to take any of these roles which are often associated with or coupled to frontend development.</p>
<p>I'm happy to refer you to others who will work with me, but right now I only accept work for projects that directly involve frontend development.</p>
