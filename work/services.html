<p>Do you have a project needing any of the following services? Please use the button below to email me so we can begin our conversation.</p>

<h2>I can help you with...</h2>

<p><strong>Progressive Web Apps</strong> — Let me help turn your website into an app. PWAs allow your site to function offline, send push notifications, and feel just like native apps.</p>
<p><strong>Frontend development</strong> — I'm most familiar with Vue, Nuxt, and static site generators. I'm happy to augment your team and build accessible, performant frontend code for your website or app.</p>
<p><strong>Frontend audits</strong> — I'll give your site a thorough inspection and deliver a report containing an actionable plan to improve your loading times.</p>
<p><strong>Implementing audits</strong> — I am almost always willing to take on short-term development contracts to implement the improvement plans I recommend, as long as the tech stack is something I'm comfortable with.</p>
