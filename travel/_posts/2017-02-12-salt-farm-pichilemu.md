summary: We visited a salt farm near Pichilemu to learn about sea salt.
---

The salt farm was pretty neat. It's a simple operation that was quite similar to rice fields. There are some dykes that allow ocean water to flow in during high tide, then they slowly drain through various pools, causing the ocean salt to dry up in the hot sun.

As the salt forms on the surface of the water, it is skimmed off and put in big piles to dry, then it's sold for 1000 CLP/kg.
