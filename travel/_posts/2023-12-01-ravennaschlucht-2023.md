[Matt](https://matthewgrill.com) and Chrissy visited us, and on the bucket list was Ravennaschlucht Christmas market. It's actually gotten nicer in recent years because they require tickets to be reserved for specific times, so the crowd is a bit thinner.

It was basically my first Christmas market of the whole year so I enjoyed many goodies. We thought the expanded drinks were nice. I got a <em lang="de">Schwarzw√§ldermarie</em>, a mulled wine with cacao and cherry liqueurs which we all agreed was the taste winner, but check the pic of the <em lang="de">Feuerzangenbowl</em> which wins on presentation!
