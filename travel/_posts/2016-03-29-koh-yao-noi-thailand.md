  comment: The trees separate the road and the beach, making excellent cover in the afternoon. They sit out here all day without worrying anout sunburn.

summary: Our last stop in south Thailand was Koh Yao Noi. Recommended to us by a friend in Pai, we wanted to finish our trip somewhere very relaxed and secluded.

Koh Yao Noi is a much quieter island than many. It's not as developed and has a large muslim population which discourages drinking, in turn discouraging swarms of party kids from visiting. That made it the perfect place to wind down our trip: relaxing, quiet days at the beach.

The first day we rented a motorbike and cruised a bit, finding many beaches and checking out the market area. With so few people it really felt like our own island, only occasionally passing someone on the road, and having whole stretches of beach to ourselves.
