summary: We walked around Villarica and saw some great murals.

With summer season coming to an end, we went to the nearest large city and caught a bus back to Santiago. I was impressed by the large number of commissioned murals around town. It really makes something nice out of an otherwise old factory building.

One artist URL I saw frequently was [alapinta.cl](http://www.alapinta.cl/). I don't know much about them but they make beautiful street art!
