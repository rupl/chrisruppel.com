  comment: Murta, or Chilean Guava, are a tart, almost minty flavor. They are normally made into marmelade.

  comment: Rose hips are better when cooked, because they have hairs that cause uncomfortable itching when eaten raw.

  alt: Avellana nuts.
  comment: The nuts of the Avellano tree are a delicious snack either raw or roasted. They turn black when ripe and fall to the ground by the hundreds. We're taking a huge bag back to Germany.

  comment: The blackberries are the most plentiful and tastiest as well. Here is a branch with berries in all stages of growth — ripening red berries, ripe black, and the moldy shrunken ones have already gone bad.

summary: A few of the local berries around Coñaripe.

After a few days in Santiago area, we finally made it down to Karin's family roots in Coñaripe. They have a family property, an island in the Rio Llancahue.

There are so many fruits and plants that were brand new to me. Our timing was perfect, with many things blooming and ripening, so we had fun walking the paths and eating tasty fruits.

The one berry I couldn't photograph was the Maki, a super-antioxidant that is often dried and sold in small packages. We did eat some that our aunt had already dried and they are indeed delicious. Perfect on top of oatmeal.
