  comment: Our first stop was actually Maha Wizaya Pagoda. I'd highly recommend stopping by this monument as well. It had a total crowd of 15 people compared to the hundreds at Shwedagon, and it was no less impressive.

  comment: All the Buddhas had these LED halos around them. It was a bit unexpected, but who are we to judge.

summary: Our second night in Yangon we visited the biggest temple in Myanmar. It has a long history dating back to the 11th centure and houses many relics.

We saw this place from afar during our taxi ride from the airport and decided we should visit at night. It's quite an attraction, pulling huge crowds that had the exact same idea as we did: shiny gold + night time = pretty.

We had a good time looking at the temple and were quite proud of ourselves: after 5 months, we finally came properly dressed for a Buddhist temple! No rental clothes for us!
