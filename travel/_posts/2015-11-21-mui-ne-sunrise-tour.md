  comment: There were a dozen or so dune buggies putting around during the sunrise. It was loud and annoying, but also the sheer awkwardness of these  trucks being driven during sunrise made it pretty entertaining.

  comment: Karin and Marcus, our companion for the day, walk down the red dunes. There was dune sliding here which was pretty fun.

  alt: Outdoor rock formations caused by water.
  comment: These rock formations appear to be caused by water like in a cave, but there are no caves to be found.

  comment: This is the fairy stream, a silly name for a nice little creek that has red sand as its bed. It was fun to walk the stream.

- caption: The tour was ok, but if you stay at Longson just get up before the sunrise and sit on the beach for free. The village and fairy stream were nice stops.
