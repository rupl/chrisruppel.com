Just a week after returning from our trip, I was off on another adventure! This time I was working, [running an installation of bustashape at Vetfest](/blog/bustashape-vetenskapsfestivalen-gothenburg-2016/) with [Afra Noubarzadeh](http://afranoubarzadeh.se/). We spent most of the week in the tents of the festival, but luckily on the free days the weather was nice and we got to walk around the city center a little bit.
