After our really rough tip to Lake Como, we were _very_ interested in getting on the road early and avoiding long lines before Gotthard. We did manage it well, and arrived in Lucerne around 10am after flying through the tunnel with zero wait. We earned some extra time to walk around and see the city center.

We walked the Chapel Bridge which was adorned with flowers, stopped inside the Jesuit church, and sat for coffee. Finally, we had lunch at Suter's Meile, a great diner with delicious rösti. I got the Rösti Komplett with ham, bacon, raclette, and fried egg.
