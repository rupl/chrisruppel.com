  comment: This is a raw betel nut. It is combined with other ingredients and chewed addictively by a huge portion of the population in Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam.

  comment: In the mountains the weather is more friendly for crops so we saw many fields as we had in the afternoon on the first day.

Day 2 was the hardest of the three. Distance-wise, we walked the farthest and also the most uphill. The main problem for Karin and me was that we both wore the wrong socks on the first day and developed blisters that made walking uncomfortable. It wasn't so bad that we slowed the group down, but we both had a bit of first-aid to administer at the end of the day once we reached the monastery.

Sleeping in the monastery was really nice. The chilly mountain air made us snuggle into our blankets. Since it was a clear night and I was sleeping near the windows, I drifted off staring at the stars.
