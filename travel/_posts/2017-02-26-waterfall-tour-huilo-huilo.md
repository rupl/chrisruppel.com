  comment: This is how most people see the Huilo Huilo waterfall. You have to be a bit daring to get the shot that John took.

summary: We took a waterfall tour that took us to many points around the seven lakes, including the Huilo Huilo Biological Reserve.

The tour description promised lots of hiking and trekking, but they drove around from point to point. We were expecting something more physical but when we saw the other groups â€” composed mostly of families with children â€”Â we decided it was just our adventurous spirit that was out of place ðŸ˜„

Some other stops on the tour are a lake with boat rentals, a brewery, and this very strange tree-covered hotel hidden in the forest.
