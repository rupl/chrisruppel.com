summary: We spent an afternoon hiking to Lago Pellaifa and found a secluded little cove to relax at.

When Karin and I first hiked to Lago Pellaifa, we'd been searching for a secluded cove which she remembered from her childhood. We didn't find it that day, but we were determined to try again. With a couple more directions from her mom we went hiking again with Katie and John. This time we found it!

When we got to the cove, there was a cow chewing its way through the brush, so we nicknamed the spot "Cattle Cove" in honor of our new friend.
