summary: We happened to be in Chicago during pride parade day and had a blast participating!

We had no plans to attend, but it just turned out to be happening the first day we visited Chicago. We saw it on Google maps and decided to check it out. We stayed in one spot very close to Addison St. It was fun celebrating with everyone, and we got a kick out of carrying around our pride gear the rest of the day as we visited other tourist attractions.
