  comment: We were treated to several nights of lightning storms while staying here. Not a single drop of rain thanks to a neat microclimate created by two nearby sand dunes that push hot air over us at night.

  comment: We took the number 1 local bus from Mui Ne town to the resort. These kids had fun saying "Hello, my name is" without actually saying their names :D

  comment: When we set up our tent we were the only ones on the grounds. That's because most people set their tents up directly on the beach! The only tradeoff is that your alarm clock is the sun, and there's no snooze button when it rises at 5:45.

  comment: The view from the resort looking northeast. The area is made up of several bays all 5-15km in length. Ours was on the bigger end.

  comment: We saw the biggest sand dollar ever on the beach. I picked it up to take it because I was so impressed, but it was alive! We set it back down and let it go about its business.

summary: With my leg almost healed, it was finally time to hit the beach! We chose Mui Ne and had a great time at an awesome resort. The people there are great and the staff are dedicated to showing us how to have a good time.
