  comment: These dunes are what you normally see as you drive around the inside of the island away from the coast. But these go all the way to the beach.

Playa Jand√≠a is a beach near the south tip of the island. Flanked by massive sand dunes, it is a very shallow, gradual beach. The tide can swallow 150m of coast as it rises and falls. The dunes are allegedly a nature preserve, but that doesn't stop people from climbing up them. I didn't do it because the signs said not to, but it was tempting.

Instead I enjoyed a long walk along this beach to the cliff at the far end. I actually started out by picking up some plastic that washed ashore and looking for a trash can, but it turned into a nice hour-long walk. Great beach for a casual stroll!
