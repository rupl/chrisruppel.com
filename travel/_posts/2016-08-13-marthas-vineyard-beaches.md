  comment: We went to Gay Head Cliffs for some food one afternoon. The lighthouse is normally an attraction but they physically moved it recently so it's closed for now.

  comment: We went to Lobsterville twice. It's Katie's favorite beach, more calm than most due to its shape along the coast.

summary: The last stop on my US tour was Martha's Vineyard where my sister Katie lives year-round.

It was the busiest week of the year, with the annual fair, perfect summer weather, and a visit from President Obama to keep things extra hectic!

I've heard many things about this place since my family started visiting Katie so it was really great to spend some time with her and John. Although many of the tourist areas are jam-packed, their house is on a quiet road in the woods, away from the hustle and bustle of the island.

We did many fun activities, but Katie had some time off so we made the most of it, doing a mini-beach tour throughout the week. We went to the beach eight days in a row and saw six beaches: Black Point, Lambert's Cove, Bunny, Losterville, State, and Great Rock beaches.
