  comment: The Skydeck, a popular attraction of the Sears/Willis Tower, added observation boxes since I last came. They stick out so you're standing on nothing but glass!

Aside from the [pride parade](/travel/chicago-pride/), our time in Chicago was done by the book. My mom is from a suburb so I've been to the city quite a few times. I was able to play tour guide for Karin, hitting all the must-see spots in basically one day.

Karin was really impressed by the architecture. She and I have been to cities that are much bigger by land area or population, but Chicago has some serious sky scraper action that's impressive even for a repeat visitor like me.
