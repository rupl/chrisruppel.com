summary: We decided to finish our trip off with a relaxing week at the beaches of south Thailand. Our first stop was Koh Phi Phi.

Koh Phi Phi was a nice island, but it's pretty popular which is always a bummer for the backpacker budget. We also arrived on the night of a full moon, which means 3x mega-party mode pretty much anywhere in Thailand üåù

We spent one day here but ‚Äî being conscious of our limited time ‚Äî were quickly ready to move on.
