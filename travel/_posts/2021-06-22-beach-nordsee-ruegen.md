summary: Family camping near a lake in Germany.

We didn't feel comfortable leaving Germany for vacation so we settled on Rügen, a common getaway island just off the mainland on the Baltic Sea.

I think I have more fun than my kid digging in sand and making sculptures. We found _Strandkörber_ with broken locks and happily returned to them each morning before the bigger crowds arrived to find them.
