  comment: This sign points to the 'secret' thermal bath that I found after a brisk 5 minute walk in the rain. These baths were filled with slightly hotter water and thick black mud.

  comment: These sheep were huddled next to each other on the way there, but on the way back they were beginning to graze again.

summary: We walked to a nearby thermal bath on a rainy day.

We enjoyed a half hour of having the place to ourselves before most of the town showed up after the rain really came down.

The walk itself was also really fun. We visited many animals along the way, most of whom seemed quite perplexed to see passerby.
