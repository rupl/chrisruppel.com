Near the hut there is a scooter lot. You can rent them to go sailing back down the mountain for 24 CHF. They supply a helmet, but your fingers supply all the braking power so be prepared! The ride down was intense, but much faster. I marked both the scooter pickup and dropoff on the [map from the hike](/travel/schesaplanahuette-day1/).

When we got up in the morning it was so foggy that we questioned the wisdom of using them, but by the time we got packed it had cleared up enough to feel safe.

Sadly, my phone didn't have enough charge the next day to warrant tracking our route back down, and it was quite different since we stuck strictly to the roads on our scooters. However, in the end it was really fun, and both of our families were pleasantly surprised that we showed up at home a couple hours sooner than anticipated.
