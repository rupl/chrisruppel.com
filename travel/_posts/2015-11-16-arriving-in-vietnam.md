  comment: The telecom infrastructure represents the city quite well. I later saw a t-shirt that said "Vietnam Telecom" with a cartoon drawing exactly like this pole.

  comment: We saw these strange lights flying into the city and have not been able to figure out what they are. If you know please leave a comment!

  alt: Outside of the Vietnam Memorial Museum.
  comment: We visited the Vietnam War Remnants museum and left with heavy hearts. I'm glad we went but I'm sad that US history classes lie about the extent of the US' war crimes during this era.

  alt: Propaganda from Vietnam War.
  comment: This is one of the less depressing things in the museum â€” an absurd set of instructions advising Vietnamese people to assist US soldiers by giving them clothes, shelter, and joining the US to fight in the war.

  comment: Rush hour was a trip. We definitely were not prepared to navigate the traffic!

  alt: 333 Export beer, and a glass filled with iced beer.
  comment: Iced beer is not a concept I thought would be good, but it's just too hot not to try. It was the right decision.

  alt: A busy party street in District 1.
  comment: We stayed in District 1, the most tourist-filled party town you can find in Saigon. The amount of insanity here is over the top. If you're looking for an unforgettable night, do yourself a favor and stop through here. Walk the alleyways, not the main streets!

  comment: The same street during the day, devoid of night life but still showing hints of chaos.

summary: Ho Chi Minh City was quite the change of pace after our slow weeks in Thailand. It's a crazy, pulsing city that is no place for a newbie traveler. We had a blast checking it out and acting young for a few days.
