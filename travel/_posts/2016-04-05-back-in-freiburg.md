Coming back after such a long time was quite interesting. Familiar things are new again, and at the same time it is very easy to remember old habits. We had fun seeing friends and family the first few days, playing our favorite card game, and eating some of the <del>food</del> <ins class="oops">bread</ins> that we've missed so much.

Other things that should be even more familiar were downright strange; we both laughed about our choice of clothes on the first morning... the sheer amount of clothing we have was overwhelming! After having only three options for a shirt for half a year, having 30 to choose from just seems odd.

I'm sure I will have some more post-travel thoughts in the future, but for now it just feels good to be back. Neither of us planned to work immediately upon returning, so we will enjoy a few weeks of downtime before resuming real life.

Until the next adventure...
