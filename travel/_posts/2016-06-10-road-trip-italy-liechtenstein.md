summary: We went on a road trip to Italy with my cousin Emily. She suggested that we swing through Liechtenstein on the way.

Emily was the last person who saw us [before our trip to Asia](/travel/paris-with-emily/). We wanted to get at least one more visit in while she's still living in Paris so we planned a road trip from Freiburg to Milan, Italy.

She asked if we could stop by Liechtenstein on the way. Switzerland isn't so big, and neither Karin or I had ever been so it was fun to cross another one off the list. It was really nice to drive a different route through Switzerland as well, completely skipping Gotthard and other long tunnels in favor of valleys and other wonderful mountain scenery.
