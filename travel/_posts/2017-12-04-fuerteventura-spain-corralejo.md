summary: We escaped from winter in Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands.

We looked at all the beaches on the island and decided to visit a couple on the northern end. Our first stop was in the Corralejo National Park. It is mostly large sand dunes but the beaches are beautiful!

We randomly picked a beach after seeing a few go by and accidentally picked a nudist beach. It was perfect because there were fewer people and way less crowded than the main beach a way up the road near the big hotels.
