We took a road trip through Switzerland to Lake Como. It was a high-traffic trip with really long lines at the tunnels and a very heavy thunderstorm while coming down the mountain of Menaggio. But after all that, we managed to slide onto the ferry with literally one minute to spare!

It was a rainy ride but the clouds broke as we got to our place, and we watched the sunset from our balcony eating pizza from the corner bistro.
