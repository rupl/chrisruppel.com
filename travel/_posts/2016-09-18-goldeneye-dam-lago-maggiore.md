Visiting this bridge has been on my bucket list for a while, and we knew it was in the area of a camping site we like to visit near Lago Maggiore on the border of Switzerland and Italy. It turns out to be directly in town, just a quick detour when coming from the highway!

We really enjoyed watching people do the bungee jump, but none of us had the courage to give it a try.

[After seeing this movie as a kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSvuHSqqGSw#t=18) and playing the N64 game for hundreds of hours, it was quite cool to see this dam in person.
