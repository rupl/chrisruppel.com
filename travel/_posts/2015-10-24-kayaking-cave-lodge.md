  comment: Day 1 — They told us to go through this small hole with the kayaks. The light coming from under was so beautiful and serene... until I heard a large POP as Ang slapped his paddle against the water when I was still inside, giving me quite a startle!

summary: We went kayaking twice in a row because it was so much fun! We did a short 2-hour and long 5-hour trip. The long one had a bit of caving thrown in for good measure.
