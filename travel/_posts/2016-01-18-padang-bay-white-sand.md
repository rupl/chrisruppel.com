  comment: The waves are huuuge but since the beach is almost pure sand, they don't harm you.

  comment: The black rocks on either end of the beach are a haven for sea life. Every once in a while some poor thing loses its way and ends up starting the process of getting converted into sand within the huge waves.

  comment: We could not figure out what this was so we showed the picture to our host at the guesthouse. He said he calls it Bulu Babi, and a quick Google search confirmed that it is a type of sea urchin.

summary: Padang Bay is a "pass-through" town with a beautiful gem of a beach. It's not a secret beach or anything, but both days we went there were max 15 people during the day.

I'm realizing how silly it sounds to continue claiming we've found the best beach ever, but we're on beach #3 and it happened again. This time it's very aptly named _White Sand Beach_ and it's in Padang Bay.

Normally people just breeze through here trying to get to Gili islands, but unlike all those other weirdos we stopped and enjoyed this relatively quiet town. Their beach is walking distance from our hostel and we're having trouble getting motivated to see anything else around here :p

The locals are completely absent during the day except for the ones working at the restaurants (which are delicious and cheap!). But around 4pm they start showing up, and it's fun to splash around and ride the waves with them, especially the kids!
