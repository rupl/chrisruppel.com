My buddy John and I took a road trip into Switzerland and hiked part of the Prättigauer Höhenweg, a (relatively) horizontal way to trek along the Rätikon mountains. We started in the town of Seewis Dorf and went on foot from there.

The first part was honestly a bit suburban as Switzerland goes, with a gravel road comprising about half of the hike. Every time we found a footpath, we took it, and after a while we were making good elevation.

Shortly after we stopped at the snow-cleared rocks (there's a waypoint on the map) we could finally see our end goal: [Schesaplanahütte](https://www.schesaplana-huette.ch).

One of the highlights was near the end. We were feeling the day wearing on us, but knew we were mostly there. Suddenly, we found a large stream cutting through the hillside with glacier water gushing down amongst the boulders. We couldn't help but stop, kick our shoes off, and rest our feet in the icy water! It definitely gave me the energy to finish, which was steeper and steeper right up until the end.

The hut itself is very well-stocked since that road I mentioned before gives auto access to the area. So we took advantage and enjoyed a couple beers and split a bottle of wine with dinner, which led me to lay down at about 8:15 and conk out. Success!
