Having seen most of what Varenna has to offer in two days, we took a ferry over to Menaggio on our last afternoon. We walked the shore to the first square and found the gelato with the longest line. It was a great shop, and I really loved my licorice+chocolate combo!

We took a dip in the water, searched for more beach glass, and decided to catch the ferry back to Varenna before having dinner. We ended up back at our local Perledo bistro for a sunset dinner. The pizza had _run out_ somehow!! However, their other dishes were delicious and in the end we were all really happy to have their ravioli.
