summary: We visited a chapel filled with skulls while in Milan.

This one was Jordan's find. We went back to Milan when he and Annette visited us and the only landmark on his list was this impressive chapel attached to an otherwise unremarkable church. Just a couple blocks away from the cathedral in the city center, it was eerie and quiet with no other people showing up while we were there.
