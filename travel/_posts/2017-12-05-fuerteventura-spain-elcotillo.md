El Cotillo is a beautiful area on the northeast end of Fuerteventura. It seems like a newer development than other areas, and was not as busy.

The main thing that struck me here was all the lava rock. The beautiful, black rocks were jutting out of the sand everywhere, providing lots of building blocks for the <em lang="es">pozones</em> and creating little mini-coves that people used as their beach spots.
