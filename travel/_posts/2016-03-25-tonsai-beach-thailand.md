summary: Next stop on our mini beach tour was Tonsai Beach near Krabi. It's a fun little jungle community right next to the more well-known Railay beach.

We found this place on accident while on the Railay beach walking street. The housing on Railay side is quite pricey, with almost exclusively resorts that start in the 1000s. We just couldn't understand where all the backpackers were staying until we stopped in a shop and asked. A dude was standing there and he said climbing a trail to the next beach was our best bet.

He led us over there because he had someone to meet, and after the trail everything just fell into place. The beach is lined with cliffs, making it a great spot to climb (or watch other people climb if you're not the type). The bungalows are super cheap and there are lots of nice hangouts to relax and read in a hammock when the sun gets to be too much.
