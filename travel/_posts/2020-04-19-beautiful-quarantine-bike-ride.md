summary: I got out for a long bike ride!
---

Like any sensible person, I've been spending a lot of time at home. But as our numbers truly dwindled, I couldn't resist and got out for a long, solitary bike ride.

I managed almost 20k and couldn't believe how delightful it was. Most of the way I'd biked at one time or another, but I did like finding the paths near the A5. The trails are a bit dusty since they're pouring new gravel on many of them, but it was mostly empty and the trees provided great shade.

I will definitely enjoy exploring those paths more in the future. Of course, a few pics of my adventure:
