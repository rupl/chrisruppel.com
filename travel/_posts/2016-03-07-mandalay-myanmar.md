  comment: We climbed up to the spiral viewpoint and got a good look at the palace. If you look past the big gold tower you can see Mandalay Hill, which we ascended afterward.

  comment: We went up the stairs on Mandalay Hill — all 1729 of them — to get a view of the city. Most stairways are helpfully lined with benches for resting as seen here.

  comment: We went up a side-path at one point and found this man sitting there completely undisturbed, drawing incredible landscapes by blotting wet ink and scraping it with a razor to reveal the white parts. They were $1.50 apiece so we bought three!
