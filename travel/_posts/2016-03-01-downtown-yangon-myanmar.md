  comment: Each block is very skinny in downtown Yangon, about 50m, with an alleyway halfway between each street. This is a nicer-looking alley.

  comment: I was intruiged by a man baking naan on the street. He'd knead the bread onto a pillow, then WHACK! He'd very quickly smack it into the oven then after 60 seconds out came a delicious baked treat.

  comment: On the way back from the pagoda we saw (and smelled!) some delicious roti. The man, who called himself Johnny, saw us and immediately started selling us on eating some. We did and it was delicious!

  comment: There are many, many grill spots like this one. The food is always out and ready to be dipped in. They're quite popular and often are full of people chowing down. Curiously, we passed by this one several times and never saw anyone eating at it.

  comment: These sugar cane presses are everywhere, and you can always hear them before you see them due to bells attached to the main wheel (not pictured).

  comment: There are ladies selling corn in many spots, and 200 kyats gets you a tin-full to feed the birds. This kid was so adorable, giving the pidgeons 5 kernels at a time. We tried to take a photo with him but he refused ðŸ˜¢

  comment: We walked through the 26th St market many times and enjoyed seeing all that was for sale. It's quite a bustling place and many times we stopped somewhere people smiled or seemed proud that we chose them.

  comment: Another corner of the 26th St market. These ladies were too busy for us since we weren't buying anything.
