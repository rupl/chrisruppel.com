  comment: We stopped on the north beach on Monkey Island for a break and a swim. We didn't photograph any monkeys but one of them did try to steal stuff out of another guy's bag.

  comment: There are over 1900 of these rocky islands jutting out of the sea. It's pretty incredible.

Our last full day on Cat Ba island the sun actually came out! We'd already planned to rent a kayak and it was a delight to feel the sunshine as we paddled along. I had Galileo recording the whole time and have the map set to satellite so it's easier to see the fishing village:

It was a bit hard to take good photos because we were A) kayaking in the ocean with waves and currents, and B) the salt water dried on both the phone and GoPro quite quickly and left huge smudges every time. Many of the photos are blurry but we got a few good ones.
