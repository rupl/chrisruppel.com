  comment: The 360° viewpoint was interesting... also home to a TV tower directly in the line of sight of the sunset.

  comment: The sun became bright red as it sunk below the horizon and fought to shine through the think haze at ground level.

summary: We moved more north into Langkawi and visited the highest peak to watch the sunset from a 360-degree viewpoint.

It was a bit hazy the day we went, but it was still a fun drive (and a refreshing hour of chilly wind!). Since we were up so high and the haze was thick, the sun was a brilliant red globe the last minutes before setting.
