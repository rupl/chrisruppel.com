  comment: Even at 9:30 when we took off it was getting hot. We were happy to feel the spray from the boat.

  comment: We passed a bat cemetery cave. We couldn't quite understand if it's a bat or man-made cemetery, but that's what our guide called it.

  comment: Our hostel, Coconut Corner, has a private boat offering tours. Most boats that we saw had 10-30 people packed in, but we had an enjoyable 6 including the driver and our guide.

  comment: Our lunch was at a most enjoyable spot, with very few other tour boats. Quite a nice difference from some of the stops!

summary: We went on a private island hopping tour with a Dutch couple we met while arriving. It was a fun day visiting great islands, beaches, and swimming holes near Koh Yao Noi.

We booked a private tour through our hostel to see many islands around Koh Yao Noi. It started in the morning and we got dropped off directly at our hostel (which is on the beach!)

A few of the places we went were common stops on other tours, but our guides took us to a few very nice places where we were alone or only with one other group. They did a great job showing us around!

We laid on beaches, swam in bays, and tried a bit of snorkeling, although the coral is not so spectacular in this area.

Our last stop of the day was a small island, so small that a quick hike up to the top made for an excellent viewpoint. We got up there in about 5 minutes, peeked around for just a moment because it was so hot, then scampered back down to jump into the cool ocean water.
