  comment: These eggs are boiled and then spun together to form strands of silk. This style of production was revived by Jim Thompson, an American enthusiast of Thai culture.

  comment: This was the way up to Wat Saket, or the Golden Mount. The mist is artificial but very welcome on a hot, sunny day.

  comment: We inadvertently participated in a ceremony involving the purple wrap around this tower. The people obviously understood that we had no clue what was happening but invited us to participate. As with Wat Pho, even the monks were taking photos or videos with cell phones so it seems they're ok with that sort of thing.

  comment: We walked from Throng Buri to Chao Phraya on our last day. We went over many foot bridges like this one.

  comment: This building was called "The Cube" and it had one entire side made of HDTVs. It showed various advertisements for the most part, but occasionally something cool like this world almanac thing.

Finally, here's a photosphere of the Jim Thompson House Museum. This guy was quite a character, serving in the US military but falling in love with Thailand during his service. He came back, re-ignited the Thai silk industry, and did a lot to promote Thai culture. His death is still unexplained, but his estate was used to start a foundation to continue preserving the old way of producing silk and other aspects of Thai culture.

Here's the "lobby" of the museum, which is actually the courtyard between six houses he bought and transformed into one house:
