summary: Another beautiful day for a bike ride.

I've been getting farther out of town with my e-bike. My goal right now is to be able to bike to Colmar and back. On this day I went to a nearby dorf before turning around and coming back the same way.

Next time I will go to Tiengen and then cut back over through St. Georgen.
