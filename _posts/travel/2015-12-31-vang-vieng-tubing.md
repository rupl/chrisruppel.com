summary: We did one of the most popular activities on New Years' Eve in Vang Vieng â€” tubing down the river!

There are tons of bars along the river, but since we started a bit early and skipped all of those stops we got to enjoy the river largely undisturbed. There were many kayakers who passed us, combined with a few light rapids made it a fun tube ride.
