  comment: This is not the temple, but the roosters had me up early in the morning so I caught the sunrise off our balcony in Padang Bay. Not too shabby.

  comment: The gates and entrances to temples and homes all have this split look. We asked a man at the temple and he said it symbolizes hands coming together which is the greeting and gesture of thanks for people of many Asian cultures.
