  comment: Our night train actually stopped in Ayutthaya but we slept through the connection. But we caught an early train to Ayutthaya so it was pretty empty.

  comment: Ya loves his cigarette drinking game... This time instead of warm water we actually drank Thai whisky, very similar to lao-Lao.

summary: Instead of staying in Bangkok we went back to visit Ya in Ayutthaya. We had a nice time singing songs and just relaxing at his wonderful guest house.

It was fun to revisit Ya and just relax for a couple lazy days before flying out of Bangkok to Singapore and then Indonesia. Plus, we had an unexpected upgrade: he was overbooked one night and upgraded us to the boat house!!!
