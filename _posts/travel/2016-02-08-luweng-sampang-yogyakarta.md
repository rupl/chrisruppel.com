  comment: There were boys jumping into the second pool and photographing each other. When I joined in it only encouraged more shenanigans.

  comment: The second pool is a much shorter fall, but was deeper and easier to jump into.

summary: Our first day in Yogyakarta we took a nice motorbike ride through the jungle-covered mountains to a waterfall.

This was a fun, cheap day activity for us to enjoy. We were still a little sore about Bromo so it was quite nice to be independent on the motorbike. The ride was pretty hilly after we got out of town, but the people living in the area were very friendly and we got lots of smiles and frantically waving children hailing our attention as we sped along.

The waterfall itself was small but enjoyable (and free!). We had fun watching kids jump into the two biggest pools and posed with a few other Indonesian folks that wanted a picture. We were the only foreigners the whole time, which always feels like a small victory.
