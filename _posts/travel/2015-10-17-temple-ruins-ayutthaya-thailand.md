  comment: Wat Mahathat features a Buddha head surrounded by trees. It is pure luck that the trees did not grow over it, and is a very interesting sight.

  comment: The headless Buddhas featured so many details despite being desecrated in 1776 and worn down over time since then.

  comment: The ruins are spectacular in their current form and tease the imagination. Did they look as detailed as the monuments we saw at Wat Pho? Unfortunately no one is sure.

  comment: We rented bikes from Ya and spent the day biking instead of haggling with the tuk tuk drivers. It was so much more pleasant to get some exercise rather than overpay to inhale carbon monoxide.

summary: The temples in Ayutthaya are almost all ruins due to the Burmese sacking this former capital city in the late 18th century. The ruins were beautiful and mysterious due to their condition.
