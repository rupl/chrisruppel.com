summary: We took a night train from Laos back to Bangkok so we could catch a flight to Indonesia. It was a fun, safe, cheap way to travel!

We'd originally planned to fly from Laos to Indonedia, but it ended up being quite expensive. We decided to take a bus/train package that would get us back to Bangkok, and fly from there.
