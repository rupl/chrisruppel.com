  comment: The chapel built by Louis XIV. You would not guess from this photo that I was surrounded by a dozen people also taking photos.

  comment: Each room in the palace had elaborate decorations, all color coded. There were rooms with the exact same carpet on the wall except in various different colors.

  comment: This is the french statue of war or something, I can't remember exactly. His disposition didn't really match the description that's for sure.

  alt: Versailles Hall of Mirrors
  comment: This room was gorgeous and had one of the more interesting histories. It has mirrors opposing each window to make it a bright, lavish tribute to the king. The only problem was the 600-odd people walking around taking selfies inside of it, which I had to crop out of this photo.

summary: We went to Versailles on our last day in Paris. Aside from the insane amount of tourists, it was pretty neat.
