  comment: The Chinese have started damming up the rivers that feed Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar. The water level is visibly affected. Word has it that these boat rides won't be possible in about ten years :(

Slow boats are a staple experience in Laos. You get on a cramped, meter-wide boat and squat for the better part of the day. The thing is, it's still superior to the unpredictable bus rides through the mountains with livestock sitting next to you.

I'd always imagined it as a paddle-driven longboat, but it has a motor. These boats aren't as slow as the name implies!

The scenery was beautiful and luckily the overcast sky never let a drop fall on us. Still, we were happy to arrive in Muang Ngoy and get back on land.
