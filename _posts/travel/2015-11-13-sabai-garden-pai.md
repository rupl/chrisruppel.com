  comment: We were treated to an excellent sunset behind the mountains most days. It was one of the few things I limped around to see during my hardest recovery days.

If you ever find yourself in Pai, skip all the hostels in the travel books and go straight to Sabai Garden. It's a quiet, low-key spot and everyone here really feels like family.

It's the type of place where you always cook extra and offer dinner to whoever is around. Someone is always strumming on a guitar, and if you have a stack of books to read, they will be gone in no time.

We met a lot of great people here and were really sad to say our goodbyes, but that's always a part of it. As Yan the owner said: <em>people come, people go ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯</em>.

We were happy to have our time here and will always remember to go _slowly slowly_.
