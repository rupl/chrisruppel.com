  alt: A bridge over a small river.
  comment: This bridge used to cross the river when it was much larger. Since the river is fed by ice from the mountains it gets smaller over time and the path has diverted away from the bridge.

  alt: A river rapids.
  comment: The river now flows to the right of the bridge when viewing it downhill. Since it is fed by ice, the water is sweet and full of minerals. We filled our bottles up while we were here.

  alt: A sulfur bath, now closed.
  comment: This sulfur-based thermal bath had a rich yellow color to it, but was unfortunately closed since 2006. I don't remember whether it was permanent or temporary.

  alt: Stone figures made from rocks containing sulfur.
  comment: These figures were made from stones in the area, giving them the same yellow hue as the untouched stone.

- caption: Hiking around Cerro Aconcagua was beautiful but watch out.. the altitude will catch you off guard if you're not careful. Drink water, bring snacks, and wear lots of sunscreen.
