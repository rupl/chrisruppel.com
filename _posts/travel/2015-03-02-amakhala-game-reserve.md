  comment: Our guide, Learnmore, who went by Lenny for short. He was extremely knowledgable and bold, getting us as close to the animals as possible while keeping us safe.

  comment: The lion was protecting a recent kill that was noticed the day before in the morning, but the lioness was fairly comfortable with us observing her two cubs. Eventually she shooed them off into the bushes but we got to watch them for at least 15 minutes.

  comment: Eventually the matriarch got annoyed with us, most likely attempting to defend the newborn that was with them. We watched the elephants for about 20 minutes because they were occupying the only path back to our lodge, and we had to let all of them cross the road first.

  comment: This herd was probably 30 strong, with the matriarch easily identifiable due to a transponder placed on her head.

summary: We enjoyed a luxurious, thrilling safari on the Amakhala Game Reserve. We saw four of the Big 5 in their natural habitats, living freely under the protection of the game park we visited.
