  comment: The rocky parts of the beach were full of life and interesting treasures. The terrain itself was quite interesting too.

summary: Our stop at Buccaneers was our last of the trip because it was so great! We stayed several days longer than we planned. It's a beautiful community situated across the entire side of a mountain facing the coast of Cintsa Bay.
