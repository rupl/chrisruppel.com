  comment: People with mobility issues can register to receive a special ard that will influence the traffic lights to give them more time while crossing the street. What a fantastic idea!

  comment: This art installment in the airport was mesmerizing. Each ball was individually controlled by a computer to create a wide array of shapes and motion sequences. No one else seemed to enjoy it but us.

summary: Due to a minor flight complication we were only in Singapore for 18 hours and did not get to explore as much as we wanted. It was nice to use fast internet, drink tap water, and throw our TP in the toilet for one night though.

Singapore is a fascinating place. It was basically created out of thin air, and although it does have some strange restrictions it's a clean, diverse, well-functioning city/country.

We originally planned to stay one full day, but due to an error while booking our flights we did not actually have a flight to Singapore from Bangkok until about 24 hours in advance! We had to book one day later to avoid high ticket cost so we were only in Singapore for one short night from about 7pm until noon the next day. Maybe on the way back up we'll stop by again.
