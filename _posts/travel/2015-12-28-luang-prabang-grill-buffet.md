summary: We got to Luang Prabang late, but immediately found a great type of food stand that should be everywhere.

Our bus ride to Luang Prabang was fairly uneventful, but due to it being late we were driving way past dinner time. We all got off the bus hungry and tired.

Karin and I avoided the tuk-tuk madness and just started walking toward the city center, which wasn't even that far anyway. We were keeping our eye out for a hostel, but looking to get some dinner first and foremost.

We saw this grill and as we sat down I was amazed by the simplicity and beauty of this system: you go to a big fridge and pick out bite-sized skewers of meat, seafood, and vegetables. They grill it all for you and tally it up in the end.

We ate like royalty for this meal!
