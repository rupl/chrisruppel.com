I've been building things on the web for 20 years. I've got a page dedicated to [my professional work](/work/) if you're interested to know more.

I was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas. In 2014 I moved to Germany to be with the love of my life. Her name is Karin and although [we love traveling](/travel/), nowadays we have a family and that's our main focus.

In my spare time I enjoy biking, gardening, and reading.
