I've been building things on the web for over 10 years now. I've got a page dedicated to [my professional work](/work/) if you're interested to know more.

I was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas. In 2014 I moved to Germany to be with the love of my life. Her name is Karin and together [we love traveling](/travel/). We were last seen {% include 'last-seen.html' %}.

When I'm in Germany I enjoy hiking in the Black Forest, eating laugencroissants, and mispronouncing German words.
