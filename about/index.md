I've been building things on the web for over 10 years now. A lot of my free time goes into [bustashape](http://www.bustashape.com), an experiment whose mission is enabling groups of people to co-create artwork.

I was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas. In 2014 I moved to Germany to be with the love of my life. Her name is Karin and together [we love traveling](/travel/). We were last seen {% include last-seen.html %}.

When I'm in Germany I enjoy hiking in the Black Forest, eating laugencroissants, and mispronouncing German words.
