title: Homegrown pink oyster mushroom box

summary: I got a home-growing kit from our local market and grew some beautiful pink oyster mushrooms.

I saw these kits at the _Münstermarkt_ mushroom stand and just had to try one. They are ready-made spawn: just slice open the box and mist it a couple times a day to maintain moisture.

In a few days it was flushing and after another three days they were ready to harvest! I made a pink oyster _Flammkuchen_, topped a porcini mushroom soup, and also had fun making [spore prints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_print).
