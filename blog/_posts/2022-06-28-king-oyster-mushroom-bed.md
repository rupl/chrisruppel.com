title: King Oyster mushroom bed

summary: My first attempt to run mycelium, with the goal of harvesting and cooking homegrown King Oyster mushrooms.

    comment: Picking a spot. I went for the north side of the bushes where there's a bit of morning light but mostly shade throughout the day.

    comment: The oyster spawn as it was delivered. The growth of mycelium is evident from the white appearance. When you look more closely than this photo affords, the fibers are clearly visible.

    comment: After kneading the spawn, the white is not as visible from far away and it is ready to be evenly spread over the wood chips.

    comment: In between each layer went a generous amount of water. Moisture is mycelium's best friend.

    alt: The hole in the ground is totally covered with fresh wood chips, such that nothing else is visible except for the very corners of cardboard.
    comment: Finally, the bed is finished with a thick layer of wood chips on top.

I finally read [Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a08763a6-14fb-40af-8b06-dfa397f22c38) in its entirety this year. It was always a subject that interested me, especially after seeing this book on my brother-in-law's shelf and reading the intro chapter.

The book is part academic, part practical. The first sections discuss the various types of mycelium, most of which reproduce by surfacing mushrooms and releasing spores. The second part is a field guide with instructions and statistics for using mycelium to achieve various goals in nature, from reforesting to growing your own edible mushrooms. I chose the latter as my starting point.

I ordered some [King Oyster spawn from Glückspilze](https://gluckspilze.com/King-Oyster-Pleurotus-eryngii-mushroom-patch-for-organic-growing-AT-BIO-301-Strain-Nr-101002) (scientific name [Pleurotus eryngii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurotus_eryngii)). I already love cooking with them, and oysters are known for their forgiving nature which is good for beginners. Glückspilze offers free PDF guides for putting their products to use, plus I referenced Mycelium Running (pp 188-192) to prepare my mushroom bed. Mine ended up being a three-layer "lasagna" as Stamets describes in the aforementioned pages.

I live in an apartment with no access to the ground, but my in-laws live near a field containing several groups of trees and bushes. So I laid the mushroom bed in the bushes at their place:

The bed was finished on June 28, a bit late in the year to get an autumn harvest, but that should give it plenty of time over winter to grow and flush the first round of King Oysters. I can't wait!
