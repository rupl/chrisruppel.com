For my birthday Karin reserved me a mushroom hike with [Dennis Regul](https://pilz.schule/), a local mushroom guide. He offers guided hikes at various times in the year, and autumn happens to be prime time for foraging. I was able to learn quite a bit about local varieties to be found in our area. We hiked around the hills on the edge of town just south of Wiehre.
