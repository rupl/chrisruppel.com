I joined [@resonatecoop](https://twitter.com/resonatecoop) yesterday.

I never signed up for any music streaming until now, because they're all clearly scams preying on both listeners and artists:

- Listeners have no guarantee of control over music, despite paying an indefinite subscription. When they stop paying, the music goes away.
- Artists receive piddly earnings on what is often their life's work and main source of income.

Resonate aims to overturn both these trends. You join as a co-op member and pay a yearly fee, which in turn gives you the right to participate in governance.

On the streaming side they call it "stream2own" which allows you to slowly purchase a track over time by streaming it several times.

There's great music up there and this really feels like what the internet is supposed to be! [Check it out!](https://resonate.coop)
