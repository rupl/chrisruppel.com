I say that as a dedicated fan of the project: This is my first post published after upgrading to the [new beta](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-version-two/)!

It was almost a no-touch upgrade. My partial that outputs photo galleries needed some love to eliminate extra whitespace, but aside from that I am upgraded and ready to start migrating to WebC.
