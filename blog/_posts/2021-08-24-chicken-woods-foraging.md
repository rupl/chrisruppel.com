I went for a walk along our neighborhood creek in late summer as the rain started ocurring regularly again, and found a beautiful flush of [Laetiporus sulphureus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laetiporus), better known as Chicken of the Woods.

At first I was a little nervous to handle it, but after consulting several guides and sending pictures to someone a bit more familiar, it was finally pretty clear I could pick some and take them home to eat!
