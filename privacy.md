**This site does not store any information about you as a visitor.**

There are no analytics. I do not track your traffic whatsoever. I self-host all images and video on first-party domains. The next section lists all third parties, with an explanation why it's on the site.

## Third-party Services

- **Google Fonts**: I use Google Fonts for typography. I pledge to self-host these files soon and eliminate this dependency.
- **Mapbox**: If you view an embedded map, Mapbox probably stores information about you.
- **Webmention.io**: If you submit a webmention, your interaction is dutifully recorded at your request.
