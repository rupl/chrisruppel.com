<p class="intro">ðŸš¨ You're offline!</p>

<p>It seems like your internet connection has gone away...</p>

<p>You can still browse around a bit, but only a few pages will work until your connection comes back:</p>

  <div class="go">
    <a class="btn" href="/" title="Home">Home</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/work/" title="Work">Work</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/about/" title="About">About</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/travel/list/" title="Travel list">Travel list</a>
  </div>
